## What is a Data Lake?

A ***Data Lake*** is a _central repository_ that holds _big data_ from many sources.

The _data_ in a Data Lake could either be structured, unstructured or a mix of both.

The main goal behind a Data Lake is being able to ingest data as quickly as possible and making it available to the other team members.

A Data Lake should be:
* Secure
* Scalable
* Able to run on inexpensive hardware

## Data Lake vs Data Warehouse

A Data Lake (DL) is not to be confused with a Data Warehouse (DW). There are several differences:

* Data Processing:
  * DL: The data is **raw** and has undergone minimal processing. The data is generally unstructured.
  * DW: the data is **refined**; it has been cleaned, pre-processed and structured for specific use cases.
* Size:
  * DL: Data Lakes are **large** and contains vast amounts of data, in the order of petabytes. Data is transformed when in use only and can be stored indefinitely.
  * DW: Data Warehouses are **small** in comparison with DLs. Data is always preprocessed before ingestion and may be purged periodically.
* Nature:
  * DL: data is **undefined** and can be used for a wide variety of purposes.
  * DW: data is historic and **relational**, such as transaction systems, etc.
* Users:
  * DL: Data scientists, data analysts.
  * DW: Business analysts.
* Use cases:
  * DL: Stream processing, machine learning, real-time analytics...
  * DW: Batch processing, business intelligence, reporting.

Data Lakes came into existence because as companies started to realize the importance of data, they soon found out that they couldn't ingest data right away into their DWs but they didn't want to waste uncollected data when their devs hadn't yet finished developing the necessary relationships for a DW, so the Data Lake was born to collect any potentially useful data that could later be used in later steps from the very start of any new projects.

## ETL vs ELT

When ingesting data, DWs use the ***Export, Transform and Load*** (ETL) model whereas DLs use ***Export, Load and Transform*** (ELT).

The main difference between them is the order of steps. In DWs, ETL (Schema on Write) means the data is _transformed_ (preprocessed, etc) before arriving to its final destination, whereas in DLs, ELT (Schema on read) the data is directly stored without any transformations and any schemas are derived when reading the data from the DL.

## Data Swamp - Data Lakes gone wrong

Data Lakes are only useful if data can be easily processed from it. Techniques such as versioning and metadata are very helpful in helping manage a Data Lake. A Data Lake risks degenerating into a ***Data Swamp*** if no such measures are taken, which can lead to:
* No versioning of the data
* Incompatible schemes for the same data
* No metadata associated
* Joins between different datasets are not possible

## Data Lake Cloud Providers

* Google Cloud Platform > [Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage)
* Amazon Web Services > [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
* Microsoft Azure > [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/)
