# Introduction to Data Engineering
***Data Engineering*** is the design and development of systems for collecting, storing and analyzing data at scale.

## Architecture

During the course we will replicate the following architecture:

# Docker and Postgres

## Docker basic concepts

_([Video source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYNwNlOrpr0&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb&index=3))_

Check notes on Notion for more Docker details.

Docker delivers software in packages in called containers. These containers are isolated from one another. If we run a data pipeline inside a container it is virtually isolated from the rest of the things running on the computer.

Docker provides the following advantages:
* Reproducibility
* Local experimentation
* Integration tests (CI/CD)
* Running pipelines on the cloud (AWS Batch, Kubernetes jobs)
* Spark (analytics engine for large-scale data processing)
* Serverless (AWS Lambda, Google functions)

Data pipeline: Gets in Data → Processes Data → Generates more Data!

## Creating a custom pipeline with Docker

_([Video source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYNwNlOrpr0&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb&index=3))_

Let's create an example pipeline. We will create a dummy `pipeline.py` Python script that receives an argument and prints it.

```python
import sys
import pandas # we don't need this but it's useful for the example

# print arguments
print(sys.argv)

# argument 0 is the name os the file
# argumment 1 contains the actual first argument we care about
day = sys.argv[1]

# cool pandas stuff goes here

# print a sentence with the argument
print(f'job finished successfully for day = {day}')
```

We can run this script with `python pipeline.py <some_number>` and it should print 2 lines:
* `['pipeline.py', '<some_number>']`
* `job finished successfully for day = <some_number>`

Let's containerize it by creating a Docker image. Create the folllowing `Dockerfile` file:

```dockerfile
# base Docker image that we will build on
FROM python:3.9.1

# set up our image by installing prerequisites; pandas in this case
RUN pip install pandas

# set up the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app
# copy the script to the container. 1st name is source file, 2nd is destination
COPY pipeline.py pipeline.py

# define what to do first when the container runs
# in this example, we will just run the script
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "pipeline.py"]
```

Let's build the image:


```ssh
docker build -t test:pandas .
```
* The image name will be `test` and its tag will be `pandas`. If the tag isn't specified it will default to `latest`.

We can now run the container and pass an argument to it, so that our pipeline will receive it:

```ssh
docker run -it test:pandas some_number
```

You should get the same output you did when you ran the pipeline script by itself.

>Note: these instructions asume that `pipeline.py` and `Dockerfile` are in the same directory. The Docker commands should also be run from the same directory as these files.

## Running Postgres in a container
_([Video source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JM-ziJt0WI&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb&index=4))_

In later parts of the course we will use Airflow, which uses PostgreSQL internally. For simpler tests we can use PostgreSQL (or just Postgres) directly.

You can run a containerized version of Postgres that doesn't require any installation steps. You only need to provide a few _environment variables_ to it as well as a _volume_ for storing data.

```bash
docker run -it \
    -e POSTGRES_USER="root" \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD="root" \
    -e POSTGRES_DB="ny_taxi" \
    -v $(pwd)/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
    -p 5431:5432 \
    postgres:13
```
* The container needs 3 environment variables:
    * `POSTGRES_USER` is the username for logging into the database. We chose `root`.
    * `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` is the password for the database. We chose `root`
        * ***IMPORTANT: These values are only meant for testing. Please change them for any serious project.***
    * `POSTGRES_DB` is the name that we will give the database. We chose `ny_taxi`.
* `-v` points to the volume directory. The colon `:` separates the first part (path to the folder in the host computer) from the second part (path to the folder inside the container).
    * Path names must be absolute. If you're in a UNIX-like system, you can use `pwd` to print you local folder as a shortcut; this example should work with both `bash` and `zsh` shells, but `fish` will require you to remove the `$`.
    * This command will only work if you run it from a directory which contains the `ny_taxi_postgres_data` subdirectory you created above.
* The `-p` is for port mapping. We map the default Postgres port to the same port in the host.
* The last argument is the image name and tag. We run the official `postgres` image on its version `13`.
* Additionally, to run this in background, you can add -d(detached mode) after -it.

So, this will start a docker container using postgres image. Now, if you type
```bash
docker container ls
```
This will show the container running. 

Difference between docker container ls and docker ps?
docker ps is shorthand that stands for "docker process status", whilst docker container ls is shorthand for the more verbose docker container list . As the accepted answer explains, there is no difference in how they work, and docker container ls is the 'newer' command, so you should probably prefer it.

What effed up here? 
Yes, this command didn't work, and you know what's the root cause? The $pwd had a space in the folder name. Argh! damn why! wasted 1 hours on this stupid issue :(

-p 5431:5432 : This maps a postgres port on our host machine to one in our container. It seemed that 5432 was already in use on my machine, so I used 5431. 5432 is the port postgresql runs inside the container, so that cant be changed!

Next install pgcli on your folder "ny_taxi_postgres_data" to access pgcli to connect to db.

Once the container is running, we can log into our database with [pgcli](https://www.pgcli.com/) with the following command:

```bash
pgcli -h localhost -p 5431 -u root -d ny_taxi
```
* `-h` is the host. Since we're running locally we can use `localhost`.
* `-p` is the port.
* `-u` is the username.
* `-d` is the database name.
* The password is not provided; it will be requested after running the command.

Finally, it connected, it asks for db password, give it what you gave above while creating container, in this case, it's root. below would be the response.

```bash
Password for root:
Server: PostgreSQL 13.11 (Debian 13.11-1.pgdg110+1)
Version: 3.5.0
Home: http://pgcli.com
root@localhost:ny_taxi>
```
Also if you haven't installed psql on your local and still wanna access, you can connect to the container directly and the use psql there. for this, use below command
```bash
docker exec -it 53aa300e8fa8 psql -U root ny_taxi
```
Now we don't have anything yet there, so we can just run something like
```bash
\dt
```
to check list of tables.

## Ingesting data to Postgres with Python

_([Video source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JM-ziJt0WI&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb&index=4))_

We will now create a Jupyter Notebook `upload-data.ipynb` file which we will use to read a CSV file and export it to Postgres.

We will use data from the [NYC TLC Trip Record Data website](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page). Specifically, we will use the [Yellow taxi trip records CSV file for January 2021](https://s3.amazonaws.com/nyc-tlc/trip+data/yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv). A dictionary to understand each field is available [here](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_yellow.pdf).

Specifically, we will be ingesting data from the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) yellow taxi data for January 2021, which can be downloaded from this [link] (https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/yellow/yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv.gz) 🚕 , the actual data from that site is stored in PARQUET these days, so csv's are backedup here.

You can copy the csv to the same folder where your ipynb file is present. you can take a look for sample data using less command
```bash
cp /Users/mycomputer/Downloads/yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv .
less yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv
```
if you wanna transfer only first n rows from this big file to another, you can use 
```bash
head -n 100 yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv > yellow_head.csv
```
Also to get the line count of the csv file, you can use: it means word count lines
```bash
wc -l yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv
```
Check the completed `upload-data.ipynb` [in this link](upload-data.ipynb) for a detailed guide. in the same directory you will need to have the CSV file linked above and the `ny_taxi_postgres_data` subdirectory.

And that's it! We have successfully ingested our data into a PostgreSQL database running in a Docker container.
Ah! Thank god!

## Connecting pgAdmin and Postgres with Docker networking

`pgcli` is a handy tool but it's cumbersome to use. [`pgAdmin` is a web-based tool](https://www.pgadmin.org/) that makes it more convenient to access and manage our databases. It's possible to run pgAdmin as as container along with the Postgres container, but both containers will have to be in the same _virtual network_ so that they can find each other.

Let's create a virtual Docker network called `pg-network`:

```bash
docker network create pg-network
```

>You can remove the network later with the command `docker network rm pg-network` . You can look at the existing networks with `docker network ls` .

We will now re-run our Postgres container with the added network name and the container network name, so that the pgAdmin container can find it (we'll use `pg-database` for the container name):

```bash
docker run -it \
    -e POSTGRES_USER="root" \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD="root" \
    -e POSTGRES_DB="ny_taxi" \
    -v $(pwd)/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
    -p 5431:5432 \
    --network=pg-network \
    --name pg-database \
    postgres:13
```

We will now run the pgAdmin container on another terminal:

```bash
docker run -it \
    -e PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL="admin@admin.com" \
    -e PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD="root" \
    -p 8080:80 \
    --network=pg-network \
    --name pgadmin \
    dpage/pgadmin4
```
* The container needs 2 environment variables: a login email and a password. We use `admin@admin.com` and `root` in this example.
 * ***IMPORTANT: these are example values for testing and should never be used on production. Change them accordingly when needed.***
* pgAdmin is a web app and its default port is 80; we map it to 8080 in our localhost to avoid any possible conflicts.
* Just like with the Postgres container, we specify a network and a name. However, the name in this example isn't really necessary because there won't be any containers trying to access this particular container.
* The actual image name is `dpage/pgadmin4` .

You should now be able to load pgAdmin on a web browser by browsing to `localhost:8080`. Use the same email and password you used for running the container to log in.

Right-click on _Servers_ on the left sidebar and select _Create_ > _Server..._

![steps](images/01_02.png)

Under _General_ give the Server a name and under _Connection_ add the same host name, user and password you used when running the container.

![steps](images/01_03.png)
![steps](images/01_04.png)

Click on _Save_. You should now be connected to the database.

We will explore using pgAdmin in later lessons.

## Using the ingestion script with Docker
You can export the `ipynb` file to `py` with this command:

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to=script upload-data.ipynb
```
headsup: I had to install nbconvert on vscode jupyter
```bash
python -m pip install nbconvert
```

Clean up the script by removing everything we don't need. We will also rename it to `ingest_data.py` and add a few modifications:
* We will use [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) to handle the following command line arguments:
    * Username
    * Password
    * Host
    * Port
    * Database name
    * Table name
    * URL for the CSV file
* The _engine_ we created for connecting to Postgres will be tweaked so that we pass the parameters and build the URL from them, like this:
    ```python
    engine = create_engine(f'postgresql://{user}:{password}@{host}:{port}/{db}')
    ```
* We will also download the CSV using the provided URL argument.

You can check the completed `ingest_data.py` script [in this link](../1_intro/ingest_data.py).

In order to test the script we will have to drop the table we previously created. In pgAdmin, in the sidebar navigate to _Servers > Docker localhost > Databases > ny_taxi > Schemas > public > Tables > yellow_taxi_data_, right click on _yellow_taxi_data_ and select _Query tool_. Introduce the following command:

```sql
DROP TABLE yellow_taxi_data;
```

We are now ready to test the script with the following command:
```bash
URL="https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/yellow/yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv.gz"
python ingest_data.py \
    --user=root \
    --password=root \
    --host=localhost \
    --port=5431 \
    --db=ny_taxi \
    --table_name=yellow_taxi_trips \
    --url=${URL}
```

My ingest_data.py looks like:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# coding: utf-8

import os
import argparse

from time import time

import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine


def main(params):
    user = params.user
    password = params.password
    host = params.host
    port = params.port
    db = params.db
    table_name = params.table_name
    url = params.url

    engine = create_engine(f'postgresql://{user}:{password}@{host}:{port}/{db}')

    df_iter = pd.read_csv(url, iterator=True, chunksize=100000)

    df = next(df_iter)

    df.tpep_pickup_datetime = pd.to_datetime(df.tpep_pickup_datetime)
    df.tpep_dropoff_datetime = pd.to_datetime(df.tpep_dropoff_datetime)

    df.head(n=0).to_sql(name=table_name, con=engine, if_exists='replace')

    df.to_sql(name=table_name, con=engine, if_exists='append')


    while True:

        try:
            t_start = time()

            df = next(df_iter)

            df.tpep_pickup_datetime = pd.to_datetime(df.tpep_pickup_datetime)
            df.tpep_dropoff_datetime = pd.to_datetime(df.tpep_dropoff_datetime)

            df.to_sql(name=table_name, con=engine, if_exists='append')

            t_end = time()

            print('inserted another chunk, took %.3f second' % (t_end - t_start))

        except StopIteration:
            print("Finished ingesting data into the postgres database")
            break

if __name__ == '__main__':
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Ingest CSV data to Postgres')

    parser.add_argument('--user', required=True, help='user name for postgres')
    parser.add_argument('--password', required=True, help='password for postgres')
    parser.add_argument('--host', required=True, help='host for postgres')
    parser.add_argument('--port', required=True, help='port for postgres')
    parser.add_argument('--db', required=True, help='database name for postgres')
    parser.add_argument('--table_name', required=True, help='name of the table where we will write the results to')
    parser.add_argument('--url', required=True, help='url of the csv file')

    args = parser.parse_args()

    main(args)
```
* Note that we've changed the table name from `yellow_taxi_data` to `yellow_taxi_trips`.

Back in pgAdmin, refresh the Tables and check that `yellow_taxi_trips` was created. You can also run a SQL query to check the contents:

```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(1)
FROM
    yellow_taxi_trips;
```
* This query should return 1,369,765 rows.

### Dockerizing the script
Now that we have confirmed the working of the ingest_data.py script, we can dockerize the whole thing.

To do that, let's update the Dockerfile. Look at the dockerfile contents.

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9.1

# We need to install wget to download the csv file
RUN apt-get install wget
# psycopg2 is a postgres db adapter for python: sqlalchemy needs it
RUN pip install pandas sqlalchemy psycopg2

WORKDIR /app
COPY ingest_data.py ingest_data.py 

ENTRYPOINT [ "python", "ingest_data.py" ]
```

Build the image: # Damn, build the fucking images, before running the container of the image! Huh! That's what dockerfile is used for - to build that fucking image!!! taxi_ingest is your image name!

This image will have base python 3.9 for you and you will install your desired packages and wget on it, and then once you build container from it, you can run your script by passing required args. yes you can directly pass the script args from docker run itself! How does that make sense no? it does!
```bash
docker build -t taxi_ingest:v001 .
```

And run it:
```bash
URL="https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/yellow/yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv.gz"
docker run -it \
    --network=pg-network \
    taxi_ingest:v001 \
    --user=root \
    --password=root \
    --host=pg-database \
    --port=5431 \
    --db=ny_taxi \
    --table_name=yellow_taxi_trips \
    --url=${URL}
```
* We need to provide the network for Docker to find the Postgres container. It goes before the name of the image.
* Since Postgres is running on a separate container, the host argument will have to point to the container name of Postgres.
* You can drop the table in pgAdmin beforehand if you want, but the script will automatically replace the pre-existing table.

All we changed in script is as below, as we wanted to get the file by wget and store locally in output.csv and use pandas to read that file instead.
```python
    csv_name = 'output.csv'

    # download the CSV file
    os.system(f"wget {url} -O {csv_name}")
    df_iter = pd.read_csv(csv_name, iterator=True, chunksize=100000)
```
## Running Postgres and pgAdmin with Docker-compose
_([Video source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKI6PkPhpa0&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb&index=7))_

`docker-compose` allows us to launch multiple containers using a single configuration file, so that we don't have to run multiple complex `docker run` commands separately.

Docker compose makes use of YAML files. Here's the `docker-compose.yaml` file for running the Postgres and pgAdmin containers:

```yaml
services:
  pgdatabase:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=root
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=root
      - POSTGRES_DB=ny_taxi
    volumes:
      - "./ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data:rw"
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
  pgadmin:
    image: dpage/pgadmin4
    environment:
      - PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=admin@admin.com
      - PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=root
    volumes:
      - "./data_pgadmin:/var/lib/pgadmin"
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
```
* We don't have to specify a network because `docker-compose` takes care of it: every single container (or "service", as the file states) will run withing the same network and will be able to find each other according to their names (`pgdatabase` and `pgadmin` in this example).
* We've added a volume for pgAdmin to save its settings, so that you don't have to keep re-creating the connection to Postgres every time you rerun the container. Make sure you create a `data_pgadmin` directory in your work folder where you run `docker-compose` from.
* All other details from the `docker run` commands (environment variables, volumes and ports) are mentioned accordingly in the file following YAML syntax.

We can now run Docker compose by running the following command from the same directory where `docker-compose.yaml` is found. Make sure that all previous containers aren't running anymore:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

>Note: this command asumes that the `ny_taxi_postgres_data` used for mounting the volume is in the same directory as `docker-compose.yaml`.

Since the settings for pgAdmin were stored within the container and we have killed the previous onem you will have to re-create the connection by following the steps [in this section](#connecting-pgadmin-and-postgres-with-docker-networking).

You will have to press `Ctrl+C` in order to shut down the containers. The proper way of shutting them down is with this command:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

And if you want to run the containers again in the background rather than in the foreground (thus freeing up your terminal), you can run them in detached mode:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

If you want to re-run the dockerized ingest script when you run Postgres and pgAdmin with `docker-compose`, you will have to find the name of the virtual network that Docker compose created for the containers. You can use the command `docker network ls` to find it and then change the `docker run` command for the dockerized script to include the network name.

## SQL refresher

Below are a series of SQL query examples to remember how SQL works. For this example we'll asume that we're working with 2 tables named `trips` (list of all yelow taxi trips of NYC for January 2021) and `zones` (list of zone IDs for pick ups and drop offs).

>Check the [homework](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/week_1_basics_n_setup/homework.md) for the session to learn about the `zones` table.

>For a more detailed look into SQL, check out [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/sql-in-a-nutshell-part-1-basic-real-world-scenarios-33a25ba8d220).

```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM
    trips
LIMIT 100;
```
* Selects all rows in the `trips` table. If there are more than 100 rows, select only the first 100.

```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM
    trips t,
    zones zpu,
    zones zdo
WHERE
    t."PULocationID" = zpu."LocationID" AND
    t."DOLocationID" = zdo."LocationID"
LIMIT 100;
```
* Selects all rows in the `trips` table. If there are more than 100 rows, select only the first 100.
* We give aliases to the `trips` and `zones` tables for easier access.
* We replace the IDs inside `PULocationID` and `DOLocationID` with the actual zone IDs for pick ups and drop offs.
* We use double quotes (`""`) for the column names because in Postgres we need to use them if the column names contains capital letters.

```sql
SELECT
    tpep_pickup_datetime,
    tpep_dropoff_datetime,
    total_amount,
    CONCAT(zpu."Borough", '/', zpu."Zone") AS "pickup_loc",
    CONCAT(zdo."Borough", '/', zdo."Zone") AS "dropoff_loc"
FROM
    trips t,
    zones zpu,
    zones zdo
WHERE
    t."PULocationID" = zpu."LocationID" AND
    t."DOLocationID" = zdo."LocationID"
LIMIT 100;
```
* Same as previous but instead of the complete rows we only display specific columns.
* We make use of ***joins*** (_implicit joins_ in this case) to display combined info as a single column.
    * The new "virtual" column `pickup_loc` contains the values of both `Borough` and `Zone` columns of the `zones` table, separated by a slash (`/`).
    * Same for `dropoff_loc`.
* More specifically this is an ***inner join***, because we only select the rows that overlap between the 2 tables.
* Learn more about SQL joins [here](https://dataschool.com/how-to-teach-people-sql/sql-join-types-explained-visually/) and [here](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Join_(SQL)).

```sql
SELECT
    tpep_pickup_datetime,
    tpep_dropoff_datetime,
    total_amount,
    CONCAT(zpu."Borough", '/', zpu."Zone") AS "pickup_loc",
    CONCAT(zdo."Borough", '/', zdo."Zone") AS "dropoff_loc"
FROM
    trips t JOIN zones zpu
        ON t."PULocationID" = zpu."LocationID"
    JOIN zones zdo
        ON t."DOLocationID" = zdo."LocationID"
LIMIT 100;
```
* Exactly the same statement as before but rewritten using explicit `JOIN` keywords.
    * Explicit inner joins are preferred over implicit inner joins.
* The `JOIN` keyword is used after the `FROM` statement rather than the `WHERE` statement. The `WHERE` statement is actually unneeded.
    ```sql
    SELECT whatever_columns FROM table_1 JOIN table_2_with_a_matching_column ON column_from_1=column_from_2
    ```
* You can also use the keyword `INNER JOIN` for clarity.
* Learn more about SQL joins [here](https://dataschool.com/how-to-teach-people-sql/sql-join-types-explained-visually/) and [here](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Join_(SQL)).

```sql
SELECT
    tpep_pickup_datetime,
    tpep_dropoff_datetime,
    total_amount,
    "PULocationID",
    "DOLocationID"
FROM
    trips t
WHERE
    "PULocationID" is NULL
LIMIT 100;
```
* Selects rows from the `trips` table whose pick up location is null and displays specific columns.
* If you have not modified the original tables, this query should return an empty list.

```sql
SELECT
    tpep_pickup_datetime,
    tpep_dropoff_datetime,
    total_amount,
    "PULocationID",
    "DOLocationID"
FROM
    trips t
WHERE
    "DOLocationID" NOT IN (
        SELECT "LocationID" FROM zones
    )
LIMIT 100;
```
* Selects rows fromn the `trips` table whose drop off location ID does not appear in the `zones` table.
* If you did not modify any rows in the original datasets, the query would return an empty list.

```sql
DELETE FROM zones WHERE "LocationID" = 142;
```
* Deletes all rows in the `zones` table with `LocationID` of 142.
* If we were to run this query and then run the previous query, we would get a list of rows with `PULocationID` of 142.

```sql
SELECT
    tpep_pickup_datetime,
    tpep_dropoff_datetime,
    total_amount,
    CONCAT(zpu."Borough", '/', zpu."Zone") AS "pickup_loc",
    CONCAT(zdo."Borough", '/', zdo."Zone") AS "dropoff_loc"
FROM
    trips t LEFT JOIN zones zpu
        ON t."PULocationID" = zpu."LocationID"
    LEFT JOIN zones zdo
        ON t."DOLocationID" = zdo."LocationID"
LIMIT 100;
```
* Similar to the join query from before but we use a ***left join*** instead.
* ***Left joins*** shows all rows from the "left" part of the statement but only the rows from the "right" part that overlap with the "left" part, thus the name.
* This join is useful if we deleted one of the `LocationID` rows like before. The inner join would omit some rows from the `trips` table, but this query will show all rows. However, since one ID is missing, the "virtual" columns we defined to transform location ID's to actual names will appear with empty strings if the query cannot find the location ID.

```sql
SELECT
    tpep_pickup_datetime,
    tpep_dropoff_datetime,
    DATE_TRUNC('DAY', tpep_pickup_datetime),
    total_amount,
FROM
    trips t
LIMIT 100;
```
* Selects all rows from the `trips` table but displays specific columns.
* `DATE_TRUNC` is a function that trunctates a timestamp. When using `DAY` as a parameter, it removes any smaller values (hours, minutes, seconds) and displays them as `00:00:00` instead.

```sql
SELECT
    tpep_pickup_datetime,
    tpep_dropoff_datetime,
    CAST(tpep_pickup_datetime AS DATE) as "day",
    total_amount,
FROM
    trips t
LIMIT 100;
```
* Very similar to previous query, but instead it casts the `TIMESTAMP` type to `DATE`, so that the hours:minutes:seconds info is completely omitted rather than show as `00:00:00`. The columns will be displayed under the name `day`.

```sql
SELECT
    CAST(tpep_pickup_datetime AS DATE) as "day",
    COUNT(1)
FROM
    trips t
GROUP BY
    CAST(tpep_pickup_datetime AS DATE)
ORDER BY "day" ASC;
```
* Counts the amount of records in the `trips` table grouped by day.
* We remove the limit of 100 records because we do not want to restrict the amount of info on screen.
* Grouping does not guarantee order, so we enforce that the rows will be displayed in ascending order from earliest to latest day.

```sql
SELECT
    CAST(tpep_pickup_datetime AS DATE) as "day",
    COUNT(1) as "count",
    MAX(total_amount),
    MAX(passenger_count)
FROM
    trips t
GROUP BY
    CAST(tpep_pickup_datetime AS DATE)
ORDER BY "count" DESC;
```
* Similar to the previous query but orders the rows by count and displays them in descending order, so that the day with the highest amount of trips is shown first.
* We also show the maximum amount that a driver earned in a trip for that day and the maximum passenger count on a single trip for that day.

```sql
SELECT
    CAST(tpep_pickup_datetime AS DATE) as "day",
    "DOLocationID",
    COUNT(1) as "count",
    MAX(total_amount),
    MAX(passenger_count)
FROM
    trips t
GROUP BY
    1, 2
ORDER BY "count" DESC;
```
* Similar to previous but we also include the drop off location column and we group by it as well, so that each row contains the amount of trips for that location by day.
* Instead of having to repeat the same line in both the `SELECT` and `GROUP BY` parts, we can simply indicate the arguments we use after the `SELECT` keyword by order number.
    * SQL is 1-indexed. The first argument is 1, not 0.

```sql
SELECT
    CAST(tpep_pickup_datetime AS DATE) as "day",
    "DOLocationID",
    COUNT(1) as "count",
    MAX(total_amount),
    MAX(passenger_count)
FROM
    trips t
GROUP BY
    1, 2
ORDER BY
    "day" ASC,
    "DOLocationID" ASC;
```
* Similar to previous query but we now order by ascending order both by day and then drop off location ID, both in ascending order.

As a final note, SQL commands can be categorized into the following categories:
* ***DDL***: Data Definition Language.
    * Define the database schema (create, modify, destroy)
    * `CREATE`, `DROP`, `ALTER`, `TRUNCATE`, `COMMENT`, `RENAME`
* ***DQL***: Data Query Language.
    * Perform queries on the data within schema objects. Get data from the database and impose order upon it.
    * `SELECT`
* ***DML***: Data Manipulation Language.
    * Manipulates data present in the database.
    * `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `LOCK`...
* ***DCL***: Data Control Language.
    * Rights, permissions and other controls of the database system.
    * Usually grouped with DML commands.
    * `GRANT`, `REVOKE`
* ***TCL***: Transaction Control Language.
    * Transactions within the database.
    * Not a universally considered category.
    * `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`, `SET TRANSACTION`
